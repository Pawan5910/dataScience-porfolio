# DataScience-porfolio
This repository consits of data science projects. As a data science enthusiast I like to enhance my skills by exploring various datasets and deriving some useful insights out of it. These projects are represented in the form of iPython Notebooks.
# Content
## [Handwritten Character Recognition- Image Processing](https://github.com/Pawan5910/dataScience-porfolio/tree/main/Bitcoin%20price%20prediction%20and%20analysis): 

## [Cryptocurrency price forecasting and Prediction using ARIMA, SARIMAX and LSTM - Dissertion project](https://github.com/Pawan5910/dataScience-porfolio/tree/main/Bitcoin%20price%20prediction%20and%20analysis): 
* This project compares the Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average eXogenous SARIMAX, and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, to find the best model for the Cryptocurrency Price forecasting and prediction. 
* The cryptocurrency used in this project is Bitcoin, and all the trading data is collected for the same. 
* This project also involves Sentiment analysis, as the sentiment scores of the tweets related to Bitcoin are also considered as a feature while training these models, thus considering the human aspects as factor for prediction. 
* The LSTM model is optimized by the application of Select K Best scores and Principal Component Analysis as a part of feature selection. 
## [Data Warehouse to store and visualize patient medical data](https://github.com/Pawan5910/dataScience-porfolio/tree/main/DataWarehouse_MedicalData): 
*	The Data Warehouse utilizes the Microsoft Azure PostgreSQL server to host a Cloud Database where all patient-related medical data is stored. 
*	The data vault along with the cloud server uses Django as a visual interpreter for the users to access and visualize patient-related data. 
* Using Django, a web-based interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI) is built for users to access and analyse patients’ data. The Django and PostgreSQL are integrated together to make the patient data available on the website. 
* The web-based interactive GUI also provides visualization using Temporal and Spatial plots for the selected patient data.
## [Breast Cancer Prediction](https://github.com/Pawan5910/dataScience-porfolio/tree/main/Breast%20Cancer%20Prediction%20Project):
* This project collects the patient’s cohorts from the pre-existing data, which is pre-processed and cleaned. 
* This is followed by the implementation of different classification models like SVM, KNN, Random Forest, ANN and Decision Trees. 
* All the results are measured and compared for accuracy and efficiency. 
## [House prediction](https://github.com/Pawan5910/dataScience-porfolio/tree/main/Banglore%20House):
* The house price prediction using regression models is conducted.
